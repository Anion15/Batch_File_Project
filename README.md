<br>
  Press any key to execute.
<br>
<br>

# Recovery key
The first recovery key is stored in the “passwords” variable called “recovery”. If you want to change this recovery key password, change the recovery password by modifying the code on line 181 or the code content in 295 and 297. If it still doesn't work, type “developerdecryptkey” in your passwords to recover it with your developer key.
